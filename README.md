Starting with a utility to play notes on the keyboard, I want to explore asyncronous key strokes and paddle shifting for tone alteration.

## Installing
It can be kind of tricky to install one of the dependencies, pyaudio.
Follow these instructions to install pyaudio on a mac:
xcode-select --install
brew remove portaudio
brew install portaudio
pip3 install pyaudio
